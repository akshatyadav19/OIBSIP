#Iris Flower Classification
This is a machine learning project that classifies the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal lengths and widths.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

#Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:


pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
#Usage
To run the project, simply clone the repository and run the iris_classification.py file:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification
python iris_classification.py
The script will load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the training set, and evaluate its accuracy on the testing set. It will then output the accuracy score and a confusion matrix.
